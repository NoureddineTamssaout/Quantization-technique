# **Titanic Dataset Analysis Using Quantization**

This project explores the Titanic dataset, emphasizing the application of data quantization techniques to simplify numerical representations while preserving analytical accuracy. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and statistical evaluations to uncover key insights.

## **Overview**

- **Quantization Techniques:** Apply numerical simplification methods to enhance data interpretability.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examine survival trends based on features such as class, age, and gender.
- **Streamlined Analysis:** Efficiently process and analyze the dataset to derive actionable insights.

## **Dataset**

The Titanic dataset is available from [Kaggle's Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). Download the dataset and place it in a `data/` folder within this repository.

## **Setup**

### **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
